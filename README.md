Katrina Robert's User Manual - My Communication Style

## What are your primary goals as a human being?
- To be of service.
- To learn something new 
- To enjoy weird and strange art (Don't ask me about [Dragula!](

## What do you want us to know about your communication style?
I'm not a very loud person, and I'm a bit of an ambivert, mostly an introvert. I can put on a good game face for about 5 minutes. I prefer text to talking face to face, and I'm best with visuals. 

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
-  I like to go down rabbit holes and tinker and explore on my own before reaching out with questions or asking for help.
- I'm highly introverted and need quiet time alone to recharge after being around people or back-to-back meetings.
- I'm happiest when I have good solid chunks of time to focus and work.
- I'm not good with firehose style type of learning. I do best when given bite-size chunks of information, then space and time to explore on my own.
- I like to start the day working on projects and I'm most productive in the afternoons and end-of-day.

## How can you best work with me?
- I need a deadline for tasks, even simple ones. If I don't give you one, please give me one. 
- I am a visual person. I have to see it (please share your screen!)
- When possible, allow me time to consider questions in advance of meetings.
- I'm a terrible multi-tasker so I may not always read or respond to chats or Slack when I'm in meetings.
- Let me know when I make mistakes and when I do well.

## What are your pet peeves?
- loud, repetitive noises. 
- toxic positivity
- circus peanuts (they taste awful) 

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
- I have no concept of time (I set a lot of reminders/timers & alarms) 
- 
- It can be difficult for me to ask for help, but I'm getting better at it.
